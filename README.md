# Transit Flow

## About this site
This is a landing page for transit flow. This was built using React. This webpage is optimised only for screens wider than 1200px. You can view the live url <a href="https://transitflow-ileri.netlify.app">HERE</a>.

## Code Base
Like the conventional React repository, this site contains the public folder and the src folder with other React files. You can preview the code by running "npm start" in your terminal.

The scr file contains the home.jsx file, where I imported all of the necessary components for this webpage.
<br>
The components folder is the folder containing all the main files. It's from here I imported all to the home.jsx, then to the App.js, then Index.js where they were displayed as a React SPA.

## Difficulties Encountered
I built this site within the space of 27 hours, so the timing was my biggest challenge, as I had a deadline to meet. 
<br>
Also, the buttons have a unique styling. Generally, the UI of this web page required skill to be developed, and I had to utilize a lot of that.
